        <h2>▶️ Introduction</h2>
        <p>This page lists my <b>best films i watched in 2025</b>, selected purely on personal impact rather than ratings or popularity. Each film stood out for a different reason be it strong storytelling, memorable characters, direction, thrill, or the ideas it left behind after the credits rolled. <br>
        The list includes a mix of genres and languages, reflecting how varied my viewing was throughout the year. These films entertained me, challenged my perspective, and in some cases stayed with me long after watching. The order is not about what is “objectively best,” but what resonated most with me in 2025.</p>

        <h2 id="about">▶️ About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Humzah, i am 24 & I really like watching movies, to the point where going a full week without watching one feels almost unnatural. Most of my movie sessions happen at night, usually when everything is quiet and my brain is most willing to overthink plot details that probably were not meant to be overthought. <br>

        I am especially drawn to movies that keep me on the edge of my seat and refuse to let my mind rest. If a film makes me pause, rewind, or stare at the ceiling after it ends, it has already won. Thrillers and whodunit movies are my comfort zone, mainly because I enjoy guessing, doubting every character, and still being wrong by the end. <br>

        My favorite show is Dark, which says a lot about my tolerance for confusion and complex timelines. My favorite movie is Interstellar, a film I admire for making space, time, and emotions feel equally overwhelming. For me, movies are not just entertainment but a nightly ritual, a thinking exercise, and sometimes an excuse to stay up later than I should.</p>

        <h2 id="end"><b>▶️ Conclusion</b></h2>
        <p>
            These were the movies I enjoyed the most and the ones that truly stayed with me. While I watched well over a hundred films throughout the year, not every movie leaves a lasting impression, and this list reflects the ones that did. Some stood out because of their storytelling, some because of the way they made me think, and others simply because they hit the right emotional or psychological note at the right time. Together, they represent the kind of cinema I naturally gravitate toward and remember long after watching. <br>
            Beyond movies, I also spent a significant amount of time watching shows, exploring longer narratives and more detailed character arcs. That experience deserves its own space and reflection, which I plan to write about separately in the future. For now, this list acts as a snapshot of my movie-watching journey—filtered, personal, and based purely on enjoyment rather than numbers or ratings. These films were more than just something I watched; they became part of my year and the way I experienced stories through cinema.
